# Basic example

This example demos a basic host application consuming components from a remote storybook application

- `app` is the host application
- `storybook` is the Storybook application

Run `yarn start`. This will build and serve both `app` and `storybook` on ports `8000` and `9000` respectively.

localhost:8000 (HOST)
localhost:9000 (STORYBOOK REMOTE)
